Admin Menu Editor lets you customize the WordPress admin menu to suit your needs.

== Description ==

Admin Menu Editor is a plugin that allows you to edit the default WordPress admin menu items and submenu items. You can add, edit, reorder, hide, and export/import menu items easily. Also change the icons, titles, URLs, and set user role based restrictions. Admin Menu Editor has a simple and user-friendly interface that shows you a preview of your changes before saving them.

- Add custom menu items with your own icons, URLs, and set user role based restrictions. For example, you can create a menu item that links to your favorite website, or a menu item that only shows up for certain user roles.

- Change the icons, titles, URLs of the existing menu items. For example, you can rename the "Posts" menu to "Articles", or change the "Dashboard" icon to something more appealing.

- Reorder the menu items by drag and drop. For example, you can move the "Plugins" menu to the top of the menu, or group the menu items by category.

- Add separators between menu items for better organization. For example, you can add a separator between the "Settings" and "Tools" menus, or between the custom menu items that you created.

- Hide any admin menu items for specific user roles or user names. For example, you can hide the "Media" menu for Editors, or hide the "Tools" menu for a specific user.

- Export your menu settings and import them to another site. For example, you can export your menu settings from your development site and import them to your live site, or share your menu settings with other users who use the same plugin.

- Reset the menu settings to the default state if anything goes wrong. For example, you can reset your menu settings if you accidentally delete a menu item, or if you want to start over from scratch.


You can access the menu editor from the WP-Admin -> Admin Menu Editor page. There you can see a preview of your current admin menu and make changes to it. You can also undo and redo your actions, and preview the changes before saving them.

Admin Menu Editor is compatible with most WordPress plugins and themes that add custom menu items to the admin menu. If you encounter any issues, please [contact us for support](#).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add a custom menu item? =

To add a custom menu item, click on the "Add New Menu" button at the bottom of the menu editor. A new menu item will appear at the bottom of the menu. You can then edit its properties, such as icon, title, URL, and User Role access. You can also drag and drop it to the desired position in the menu.

To add a custom icon, you can choose from the default WordPress icons, Dashicons, or upload your own custom icon.

To add a custom URL, you can enter any valid URL, such as https://www.jeweltheme.com, or use a WordPress-specific URL, such as admin.php?page=my-plugin.

You can also hide this custom menu for specific user role or specific user name too.

= How do I change the icon of a menu item? =

To change the icon of a menu item, click on the icon next to the menu title. A popup window will appear with a list of available icons. You can choose from the default WordPress icons, Dashicons, or upload your own custom icon.

For example, if you want to change the icon of the "Posts" menu to a pencil icon, you can select the Dashicon "dashicons-edit" from the list.

= How do I export and import my menu settings? =

To export your menu settings, click on the "Export" button at the top of the menu editor. A JSON file containing your menu settings will be downloaded to your computer. You can then use this file to import your menu settings to another site.

To import your menu settings, click on the "Import" button at the top of the menu editor. A popup window will appear where you can upload the JSON file that you exported from another site. Your menu settings will be overwritten by the imported file.

Please note that the import and export functions only work for the menu settings, not for the menu items themselves. If you have custom menu items that link to specific plugins or pages, you will need to install those plugins or create those pages on the other site as well.

= How do I reset my menu settings to the default state? =

To reset your menu settings to the default state, click on the "Reset" button at the top of the menu editor. A popup window will appear where you can confirm your action. All your menu changes will be discarded and the original WordPress admin menu will be restored.
